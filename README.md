# VibeFit: The AI-Powered Virtual Try-On Experience

‚ú® **Wear Your Imagination. Instantly try on any look with your virtual twin.** ‚ú®

VibeFit is a cutting-edge web application that uses the power of the Google Gemini API to offer a seamless and photorealistic virtual try-on experience. Users can upload a photo of themselves, transform it into a professional model image, and then experiment with a dynamic wardrobe of clothing to create the perfect outfit.

## üß† How It Works: The Gemini API in Action

The core of VibeFit is its intelligent use of the Gemini API for complex image-to-image and text-to-image tasks. The application makes several distinct types of calls to the API:

1.  **`generateModelImage`**:
    -   **Input:** A user-uploaded image.
    -   **Prompt:** A detailed prompt instructs the AI to act as a fashion photographer, cleaning the background, standardizing the pose, and preserving the user's face, body type, and identity to create a "virtual twin."
    -   **Output:** A clean, e-commerce-style model image.

2.  **`generateOutfitImage`**:
    -   **Input:** The base model image and one or more garment images.
    -   **Prompt:** Instructs the AI to act as a virtual stylist. It's told to preserve the model's identity, pose, and background while realistically fitting the new garments. It also includes specific styling instructions, like tucking a shirt in.
    -   **Output:** The model wearing the new outfit.

3.  **`generateVirtualTryOnFromLook`**:
    -   **Input:** The base model image and a "look" image containing an outfit.
    -   **Prompt:** The AI is tasked with identifying the main garments in the "look" image and transferring them onto the base model, preserving the model's identity and pose.
    -   **Output:** The model wearing the outfit from the look image.

4.  **`remixGarment`**:
    -   **Input:** The current image of the model wearing an outfit, a text prompt from the user (e.g., "make it denim"), and the name of the garment to modify.
    -   **Prompt:** A highly constrained prompt that tells the AI to *only* modify the specified garment according to the text prompt, leaving the person, pose, background, and other clothes completely unchanged.
    -   **Output:** The model wearing the remixed garment.

5.  **`generatePoseVariation`**:
    -   **Input:** The current image of the model in a styled outfit and a text instruction for a new pose.
    -   **Prompt:** Instructs the AI to change *only* the model's pose while keeping the person's identity, the outfit, and the background style exactly the same.
    -   **Output:** The model in the same outfit but in a new pose.

## üì¶ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
-   A valid Google Gemini API key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibefit.git
    cd vibefit
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The application requires your Google Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable. The code is already configured to read `process.env.API_KEY`. How you set this depends on your operating system and deployment environment. For local development, you can use a tool like `dotenv` or set it in your shell.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in your terminal) to view it in your browser.
